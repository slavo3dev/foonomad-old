# Digital Nomad Skills to Develop

### Digital nomads blend work with travel.

### They earn money online and are location independent, or nomadic, meaning they are not tied down to one particular place or location.

### Digital nomads are also characterised by the type of work they do.

### As the term suggests, their work is digital by nature and while many digital nomads are self-employed, they may also be a startup owner, or part of a remote team.

### Although many believe that remote workers are the same as digital nomads, this is not strictly true.

### Both can work from anywhere. The difference is that remote workers tend to work from home or local third places, while digital nomads are nomadic in nature; they move around from place to place.
